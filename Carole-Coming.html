<h3><b><strong>Legacy:</strong></b></h3>
<p>After losing her husband and child on 9/11, Harper Lee Sutton poured her heart and soul into her theater career. Now she has it all- she's one of the most successful Broadway actresses in the business; she has a beautiful loft apartment in Manhattan; and the most gorgeous bachelor in NYC is at her beck and call. But when she finds out that her beloved grandmother's death was no accident, she leaves it all behind to find the killer. While she's home in Simmons Ridge--the prettiest small town west of I-95--she discovers her lost daughter is alive. Along with childhood friend, Amy, and arrogant-but-brilliant ex-NYPD detective, Sam Harrington, she hopes to not only solve her grandmother's murder, but rescue her precious daughter. But the killer might also be the kidnapper. And he has other plans...</p>

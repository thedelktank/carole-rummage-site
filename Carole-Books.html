<div id='darkdancecontent'>
    <p>Elaina (Laney) Lowell has lost everything in a tragic accident; her parents and younger brother, her home in the beautiful Salt Lake Valley, even her promising future in gymnastics. She’s arrived in the small town of Columbia on the Albemarle Sound in North Carolina to stay with her only remaining family, Helen and Walter Jamison. They’re older and childless, but seem eager to have Laney come live with them—at least Uncle Walter does. Aunt Helen seems a little less welcoming. Laney suspects she might be taking her in out of a feeling of duty to her dead brother even though she hadn’t seen him for fifteen years. Still, the summer before Laney’s senior year in high school is one of gradual healing. 
        When Uncle Walter discovers Laney’s interest in wolves, he gets her involved in one of his favorite causes—saving the endangered red wolves. Aunt Helen was one of the bright stars at the Peabody Conservatory and now she gladly helps revive Laney’s interest in music. Then there’s Matthew Purser, a handsome pre-med student at UNC who is home for the summer. He takes a strong interest in Laney. He has the advantage of being the familiar, boy-next-door that her aunt and uncle approve of.
    However, Laney’s interest focuses on Gabe Randall, a talented young artist and ready listener. He’s as interested in wildlife, especially wolves, as she is. Laney is immediately fascinated by the handsome Gabe, attracted to him in a way she’s never experienced before, and he responds in kind. But Gabe has a dark secret--one that has kept him from having close friends, much less a girl friend. 
        Will the charm of the small southern town, the opportunity to get involved in a good cause, and her passion for Gabe offer Laney a safe haven for her grieving heart? Or will the light and happiness she found disappear when Gabe’s shadowy past is revealed?

<div id='poem'><i>The night falls.
        As the moon rises so does my desire.
        I pace the room like an animal caged,
        Trapped and alone.

        Wolves howl in the distance.
        I yearn to be one with them,
        Fearless, night-silent, and powerful
        I would raise my voice in their song.
